            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            
            <h2>Definitions</h2>
            <p>In this Policy, a reference to the "Provider", "we", "our", or "us" means NUERLO. References to "you", "User", "licensee", "licence holder" and "your" are to users of services provided by the Provider.</p>
            
            <h2>Preamble</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of "Personal Data" by us. As used in this policy, "Personal Data" means information that would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name, address or location, telephone number or email address. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of Personal Data is gathered, how the Personal Data is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose Personal Data, and how we safeguard your Personal Data.</p>
            
            <p>This Privacy Policy also explains our commitment to you with respect to our use and disclosure of non-personal browsing and site usage data that we collect as the provider of the Services. Unless otherwise noted on a particular site or service, this Privacy Policy applies to your use of all Services that we operate, including Portals, Channels, News Feeds, Profiles, Learning, Instant Messages, together with other services and platforms operated by us and any related services, tools or applications.</p>
            
            <p>Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements ("Applicable Data Protection Laws"). According to Applicable Data Protection Laws, you may be entitled to know the identity of your "Data Controller" i.e., the legal entity which determines why and how your personal data is processed. In most cases, this will be the Provider.</p>
            
            <p>Our most important asset is our relationship with our user community. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of the Personal Data of our users. By accessing or using any of the Services, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Principles</h2>
            <p>The Provider is committed to handling responsibly the information and data we collect about you through our Services, whether Personal Data or non-personal browsing and site usage data. We have designed our Privacy Policy consistent with the following principles (the "Principles"):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only the minimum amount of information reasonably necessary to provide you with Services should be collected and maintained, and only for so long as reasonably needed or required;</li>
                <li>Information you provide through our Services, or that we gather as a result of your use of our Services, should not be used for marketing or advertising purposes (unless permission has been granted), nor should it be provided voluntarily (without your permission) to anyone else unless required; and</li>
                <li>If we are required to provide anyone with your Personal Data (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then provided we have collected and retained an email address for you, we will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless prohibited by law or we are otherwise advised not to notify you on the advice of lawyers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Personal Data we Collect</h2>
            <p>We may collect Personal Data through our Services, including without limitation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>when you provide us with your Personal Data such as by sending an email to us or signing up to receive updates from us;</li>
                <li>when you subscribe to one of our News feeds, Channels, Group chat, Surveys, Learning, Instant Messages, special notifications, email, app, and web notifications or related services;</li>
                <li>when you create a user Profile;</li>
                <li>when you provide Personal Data in connection with your participation in News feeds, Group chat, Channels, Surveys, Learning, Instant Chats, Messages, special group notifications lists, email, app, push and web dropdown notifications or related services;</li>
                <li>Cookies used to track logins, sessions, and collect anonymous traffic;</li>
                <li>Payments for managing your finances, including payments and withdrawals, including other use of PayPal, Stripe or other payment services as required or applicable;</li>
                <li>Registration or connection via your logins and APIs including but not limited to LinkedIn, Facebook and Google;</li>
                <li>IP addresses, URLs visited, and related information recorded for all site visitors for the purpose of site traffic analytics and captured as part of normal operation in our server logs.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>What we do with Personal Data</h2>
            <p>We use the collected data for various purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide and maintain our Service.</li>
                <li>To notify you about changes to our Service.</li>
                <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Services when you choose to do so.</li>
                <li>To provide customer support.</li>
                <li>To gather analysis or valuable information so that we can improve our Service.</li>
                <li>To monitor the usage of our Service.</li>
                <li>To detect, prevent and address technical issues.</li>
                <li>To provide you with news, special offers and general information about other goods, services and events which we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about unless you have opted not to receive such information.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Retention of Data</h2>
            <p>We will retain your Personal Data generally for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
            
            <h2>Disclosures of Personal Data</h2>
            <p>In general, it is not our practice to disclose Personal Data to third parties. We may share your Personal Data in two instances:</p>
            <p>First, we may share Personal Data with our contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Services.</p>
            <p>Second, we may disclose your Personal Data to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and related agreements; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public.</p>
            
            <h2>Transfer of Data</h2>
            <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organisation or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>
            <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
            
            <h2>Reorganisation or Spin-Offs or similar business transaction</h2>
            <p>The Provider may transfer some or all of your personal and/or non-personal browsing information to anyone as a result of a reorganisation, spin-off, or similar transaction. Upon such transfer, the acquirer's privacy policy will apply. In such an event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you and to ensure that at the time of the transaction the acquirer's privacy policy complies with the Principles.</p>
            <p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
            
            <h2>Security of Personal Data Collected via the Services</h2>
            <p>NUERLO has implemented reasonable measures to protect against unauthorised access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal Data that we store and control. However, no website can fully eliminate security risks. Third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
