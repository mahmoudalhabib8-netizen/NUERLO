            <h2>15. About these Terms</h2>
            <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service and will notify you of significant changes to terms.</p>
            <p>Changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms of a Service, you may discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
            <p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will be paramount.</p>
            <p>These terms control the relationship between the Provider and you. They do not create any other beneficiary rights.</p>
            <p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't act right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as acting in the future).</p>
            <p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
            <p>The laws of the United States will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms, or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of the United States and you and the Provider consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.</p>
            
            <h2>16. Whole agreement</h2>
            <p>These terms and any applicable additional terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Provider relating to the Service and supersede all prior communications and/or agreements between you and the Provider relating to access and use of the Services.</p>
            
            <h2>17. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Provider offers the Service (including all content available on or through the Service) as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Services, express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>
            <p>The Provider does not warrant that the functions of the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, that content made available on or through the Services will be error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that any servers used by the Provider are free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>
            <p>The Provider does not warrant or make any representation regarding use of the content available through the Services in terms of accuracy, reliability, or otherwise.</p>
            
            <h2>18. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Provider be liable to you on any legal theory for any incidental, direct, indirect, punitive, actual, consequential, special, exemplary, or other damages, including without limitation, loss of revenue or income, lost profits, pain and suffering, emotional distress, cost of substitute goods or Services, or similar damages suffered or incurred by you or any other that arise in connection with the Services (or the termination thereof for any reason), even if the Provider has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Provider is not responsible or liable whatsoever in any manner for any content posted on or available through the Services (including claims of infringement relating to that content), for your use of the Services, or for the conduct of others on or through the Services.</p>
            <p>Certain jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to you. In these jurisdictions, the foregoing exclusions and limitations will be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
            <p>Where permitted by law, the liability of the Provider to you on any account whatsoever will not exceed your cost of acquiring the Service.</p>
